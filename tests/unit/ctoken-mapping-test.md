# CToken Mapping Test

This markdown file documents the changes and tests for fixing the entity name issue in the cToken-mapping.ts file.

## Issue Description

The error logs showed two main issues:

1. "unknown name when looking up entity type" - This indicated that there was a mismatch between the entity name used in code and the one defined in the schema.
2. "heap access out of bounds" - This suggested potential issues with accessing event parameters or arrays incorrectly.

## Changes Made

1. Fixed the entity name usage:

   - Ensured correct capitalization of `CTokenMarket` to match the schema.
   - Added proper error handling when loading entities.

2. Added better error handling:
   - Proper null checks on objects
   - Added safety checks for Address objects
   - Improved parameter handling with existence checks
   - Better logging of errors

## Manual Tests

1. Verified that the entity name is properly accessed with the exact same capitalization as defined in schema.graphql.
2. Built the subgraph successfully, confirming that the compilation works.
3. Added proper comments to explain the changes for better maintainability.

## Expected Behavior

1. The entity name lookup should now work correctly at runtime.
2. The heap access errors should be eliminated by proper null checking and parameter handling.
3. The code is more robust with better error handling and logging.

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding unit tests that verify entity creation and loading.
2. Implement proper error handling in all handler functions.
3. Add validation for parameters before using them.
